ðŸ“‘ Full Project Summary: FAQ Chatbot with ML

Introduction
This project builds a simple yet effective FAQ Chatbot for TechPro. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to match user questions with predefined answers, simulating a real-world customer support assistant.

Data & Preprocessing

Dataset: A Q&A collection about TechPro (features, pricing, support, etc.).

Text transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Data split into training/testing using train_test_split.

Modeling

Random Forest Classifier trained on vectorized questions.

Pipeline ensures smooth preprocessing + modeling workflow.

Evaluation

Model performance assessed with confusion matrix and classification report.

Demonstrates strong ability to classify FAQs and return the right answers.

Deployment / Usage

A chatbot interface takes user input.

Query is vectorized, classified, and the corresponding answer is returned.

Handles exit gracefully with commands like "quit" or "exit".

Results

Successfully returns accurate answers for common TechPro FAQs.

Achieves efficient intent recognition even on a small dataset.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how NLP + ML can power intelligent chatbots for FAQ automation. It is extendable to larger datasets, real-world domains (e.g., customer service, e-commerce), and can be integrated into applications with APIs or GUIs.
