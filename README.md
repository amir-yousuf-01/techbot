# techbot
This project is a simple, end-to-end FAQ chatbot built in a Jupyter notebook that answers common questions about a fictional product called TechPro. It demonstrates a classic TF-IDF + machine learning approach for matching user queries to the closest known question and returning its predefined answer.
